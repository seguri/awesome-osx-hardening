# Contributions Guidelines

Before submitting pull request please :

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure the list is useful before submitting. That implies it has enough content and every item has a good succinct description.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com) (AP style).
- Use the following format: `[List Name](link)`
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- The body of your commit message should contain a link to the repository.
- Check that it's not already in the list
- Make sure that it's not an outdated resource that is no longer useful
- It doesn't link to an illegal source, like a book that is illegally distributed
- **Finally** please remember that every link and contribution no matter how small it is, is highly appreciated and encouraged as it helps gather all the resources in one place.
